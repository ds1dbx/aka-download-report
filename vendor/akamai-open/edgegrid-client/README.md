[Akamai {OPEN} EdgeGrid Authentication] for PHP

[Akamai {OPEN} EdgeGrid Authentication]: https://developer.akamai.com/introduction/Client_Auth.html

This library implements the Akamai {OPEN} EdgeGrid Authentication scheme on top of [Guzzle](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle).

For more information visit the [Akamai {OPEN} Developer Community](https://developer.akamai.com).

## Installation

This library requires PHP 5.5+, or HHVM 3.5+.

To install use [`composer`](http://getcomposer.org):

```sh
$ composer require akamai-open/edgegrid-client
```

## Usage

```php
$client = new Akamai\Open\EdgeGrid\Client([
	'base_uri' => 'https://akaa-baseurl-xxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxx.luna.akamaiapis.net'
]);

$client->setAuth($client_token, $client_secret, $access_token);

// use $client just as you would \Guzzle\Http\Client
$response = $client->get('/billing-usage/v1/products');
```

### Using a Credentials File

We recommend using a `.edgerc` credentials file. Credentials can be generated using information on the developer site at: https://developer.akamai.com/introduction/Prov_Creds.html

Your `.edgerc` should look something like this:

```
[default]
client_secret = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx=
host = xxxxx.luna.akamaiapis.net/
access_token = xxxxx
client_token = xxxxx
```

To utilize this use the factory method `\Akamai\Open\EdgeGrid\Client::createFromEdgeRcFile()`.

To create a client using the `default` credentials, in an .edgerc file that exists inside the HOME directory of the web server user, or in the current working directory:

```php
$client = \Akamai\Open\EdgeGrid\Client::createFromEdgeRcFile();

// use $client just as you would \Guzzle\Http\Client
$response = $client->get('/billing-usage/v1/products');
```

Or, specify a credentials section and/or `.edgerc` location:

```php
$client = \Akamai\Open\EdgeGrid\Client::createFromEdgeRcFile('example', '../config/.edgerc');

// use $client just as you would \Guzzle\Http\Client
$response = $client->get('/billing-usage/v1/products');
```
